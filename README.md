### Episode 6: Real-Time Messaging with Turbo Streams

Summary

In this episode, we implemented real-time messaging using Turbo Streams in our Rails application. We enhanced the Message model to broadcast updates when a message is created, updated, or deleted. This ensures that all users receive instant updates without needing to refresh the page.

Key Features:

    Live message updates: Messages are broadcasted automatically when created, updated, or deleted.

    Turbo Streams integration: Leveraged broadcast_append_to, broadcast_replace_to, and broadcast_remove_to.

    Efficient UI updates: Ensured seamless user experience by dynamically updating the message list.

Implementation Details:

    Added after_create_commit, after_update_commit, and after_destroy_commit callbacks in Message model.

    Used Turbo Streams to append new messages, update existing ones, and remove deleted messages.

Updated partial views to handle real-time rendering.
